## Scenario
In this final project I studied the covid impact in CitiBike, a bicycle sharing in New York City. For these I did an exploratory analysis since the start of the operations (June 2013) until February 2022. Then I decided to compare March, April and May in 2019, 2020 and 2021 to see if had any changed in the customer behavior.

## Objective
* Check if covid had an impact in the customer behaviors while renting bicycles in New York City.

## Data Set
- Provided by CitiBike, see the info of the dataset [here](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data);
-  Download the CitiBike [data](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html);
- 104 excel files, one per month;
- Over 140 millions of rows;
- Two different data format - It was necessary to standardize them.

## Tools and methods

### Trello - using agile method (Kanban)
Trello is a visual work management tool. I used trello to organize and manage the activities, I divided the activities into four main groups: goal, to do, doing, done.

### Github
Github is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. I used it to share the files and keep a backlock of the updates. Check my [repository](https://github.com/cosfer2804/ironhack_final_project)

### Tableau
Tableau is a visual analytics engine that makes it easier to create interactive visual analytics in the form of dashboards. The main use of tableau was to visualize and deep dive in the data to find customer behaviour patterns. The data that I used in this study had more than the limit provided by tableau public, so if you want to see the dashboards you need to download it. Check my [dashboards](https://github.com/cosfer2804/ironhack_final_project/tree/main/Tableau).

### Python
I divided the work done in python into four notebooks.
In the [concat - newformat](https://github.com/cosfer2804/ironhack_final_project/blob/main/Python/concat%20-%20newformat.ipynb) I merged the months that had the new format in one excel file, It was from January of 2021 until February of 2022.

In the [concat - newformat](https://github.com/cosfer2804/ironhack_final_project/blob/main/Python/concat%20-%20newformat.ipynb) I merged the months that had the old format in one excel file per year, from June 2013 until December 2020 - input 91 excel files, output 8 files.

In the [eda - new format](https://github.com/cosfer2804/ironhack_final_project/blob/main/Python/eda%20-%20new%20format.ipynb) and [eda - old format](https://github.com/cosfer2804/ironhack_final_project/blob/main/Python/eda%20-%20old%20format.ipynb) I standardized both formats in one to work with them together on Tableau.

### Analysis
#### Overall
First it was necessary to understand the overall. In the plot below we can see how the trips worked over the years.

In this plot we see that normally the renting drops during the winter (or cold weeks) and increase in summer or good weather days. Also, itâ€™s possible to see that covid dropped the amount of the trips, specially in the first restrictions. Further the trips start rising again but in 2020 the amount of trips dropped around 5% comparing to 2019.

Looking at the chart 'Trips by Day' we see that after covid, for the first time the trips on Sunday and Saturday were more popular than trips on weekdays. 

If we look at the users type the number of trips for casual users increased in 2020 and 2021.

After these analyses, I decided to dig deep and try to understand the impacts of covid on the bike rental system. To do this, I analyzed the months of March, April and May 2019, 2020 and 2021. All the next installments are filtered with this time frame.

PS: The colors of the users type is going to be the same in the next plots.


#### Station Growth
In the gif below we see the growth in the number of bicycle stations over the years.

#### Average Trip Duration

<img width="1000" alt="KNeighbors" src="https://github.com/cosfer2804/Projects-Repository/blob/main/CitiBike/SS/average_trip.png">

In the plot above I saw that the average trip duration in by day in 2020 increased comparing to 2019. That means that before covid people used to rent the bicycle to go to work. The average trip was around 10 to 17 minutes. And during the weekends that time increase a little bit. Also, in 2021 the average trip drops, still a little bit higher than 2019, but it seems to be returning to the level before the pandemic.

#### TOP 10 Stations 

The last step of these project was to analyzed the top stations in March, April and May in 2019, 2020 and 2021 and see if they changed during the pandemic.

<img width="1000" alt="KNeighbors" src="https://github.com/cosfer2804/Projects-Repository/blob/main/CitiBike/SS/TOP10%20stations.png">

As we can see above, the most popular stations in 2019 were nearby other public transportation stations. For example, Pershing Square North is nearby NYC Central Station.

In 2020, the most popular stations were close to tourist sites or recreational areas as Central Park and 12th Ave & W 40th St (nearby Hudson River Park).

Also if we look in 2019 during the weekends, it's possible to see that the popular stations seems to be similar as during the week in 2020. People were riding bicycle as leisure during the beginning of the pandemic. It's important to see that the stations nearby Broadway during the weekend in 2020 weren't that popular, because most of the time Broadway plays were closed.

In 2021, we see that some stations are getting popular again, for now it's kind of a mix with 2019 and 2020.

### Insights
* People in 2020 were using CitiBike as leisure, instead of going to work. At the same time, we see that casual trips increased, maybe because people thought that wasn't worth to buy the subscription for all the year without knowing what was going to happen with covid.
* 2021 seems to start going back to normality, but still far from it.
* In 2020, even with the pandemic, the amount of trips dropped only 5%, but in 2021 increased 41%. 

### Next Steps
Check if in the future the customer behavior changed only during the pandemic or if covid created new pattern over the next years.
