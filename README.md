# Data Analyst Projects:

This repository contains all the projects I have done to improve my data analyst skills. 
I am still working on different projects, so this repository will continue to be updated. 
It is worth mentioning that each project has a unique objective and different techniques were approached in them. They all have a readme file discussing the steps I performed and the results I achieved.


## Citibike
 I did an exploratory data analysis to see how the pandemic affected the bicycle sharing system in NYC.
 
 ### Info:
 - Big data base: over than 140 millions of rows;
 - Used python to clean and standardize 104 excel files;
 - Used tableau for the visualization e apresentação dos dados;
